# Burger App

## How to use this application:

1. `Add burgers to the list of uneaten burgers` by entering them in the input field and pressing the submit button.

2. To `eat burgers`, click on their respecive "Eat Burger" buttons.

3. You will see the burgers that have been eaten dissappear from the list of uneaten burgers and appear in the `burger graveyard`.

   > That's basically it. Not very exciting, I know, but this app was good practice for building full-stack web apps using only `Express, MySQL, and Handlebars`.
